              Sam is a Lambda student with a couple years of computer science background from New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. When I am not making websites I enjoy playing video games
              and guitar. On the weekends I work as a Home Inspector/Handyman. Also I am not a Troll.

              Kevin is a full stack developer nearing the completion of his training at Lambda School. As team lead he assisted in all aspects of design and problem solving, during the production
              phase of this application. He is strong with dev ops, front end, back end, and styling in general. He really enjoyed the challenges associated with tying the python code provided by data
              scientists into the full stack application.

              <div class="tabs-item-title">Daniel Starling</div>
              Daniel started his career as a bartender which taught him how to adapt quickly and work on a team. He eventually became the Operations Manager at the bar he worked. Through this he gained a lot of
              experience in being in charge of organizing and bringing many moving pieces together. His natural draw towards technology and problem solving led him to coding as he was looking to
              transition out of the hospitality industry. This led him to start scraping websites with python which is where he truly realized the power of coding. This is also where he started his Open
              source work that would land him an Engineering Intern role at a nonprofit of over 3,000 members. This accelerated his path in learning how to bring the ideas he has to life to make a
              difference.
